### Project #7
**Timeline**: 2024.7.15 - 2024.10.23

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm with various fitness functions, including Sudoku, minimum value, maximum value, checkers pattern, and distance to center. Solving a Sudoku puzzle is particularly challenging for Genetic Algorithms due to the potential to get stuck in local maxima, a problem that becomes more pronounced as grid size increases. In contrast, other fitness functions have a single maximum solution, allowing the population to steadily improve over time.

### Installation guide
- You can follow [these general installation steps](https://github.com/Andrew-Marked-One/General_installation_guide/blob/main/README.md). This guide provides instructions for installing the necessary tools.

### Controls
- **Escape**: Quit

### GUI
- The interface features self-describing GUI components for controlling Genetic Algorithm parameters, such as grid size, population size, mutation rate, random genes rate, elite survival rate, and fitness functions. The interface also includes a combo box for changing the window size.
- If the mutation rate and random genes rate do not add up to 100, the remaining percentage will be allocated to the recombination rate.
